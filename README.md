## Overview

A simple project that reflects the expenses on a chart. Among its features, it's possible to see the total amount as well as the spending during the last seven days. The best part of the project is its interactivity thanks to the tooltips that pop up when hovering the spending chart.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

- Write semantic HTML with BEM classes
- Style the structure with clean CSS code
- Add the interactivity with a simple JS file

### What I learned

I learned how to read json files by using fetch and promises as well as writting js code that's easy to understand and read. On the other hand, I reinforce my overall file structure with a readble approach.


### Continued development

Most of what I did on this project can be reduced to less code by using framework such as React. So, it'll be a great way to keep learning and improving this app.
